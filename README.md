# LE-Discord-Bot
The discord bot I'm using for a project I'm working on

It's simple, but it will evolve as the project evolves. 
For now, only messages are sent automatically, and theres some reaction roles.

Eventually there will direct ties to my game such as rewards, crew chats, and whatever else I can think of along the way.
